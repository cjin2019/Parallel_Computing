translate the pixel plane x:[-2, 2], y:[-1/2, 1/2]
so that the origin will be in the middle
 want to zoom into the plane interactively
values will change!!!!
make the bounds variable

for each pixel (x, y)-->color?
(x, y)--> (a, b) [represents a+bi]

size of the window

sequence for each pixel
z0 = 0 + 0i
loop: (limit on the number of steps)
1. Zi = (z_(i-1))^2 + C
	C = the value of corresponding (a, b) [a+bi]

count the number of steps
(number of steps probably a var)
if (steps == maxSteps) color the pixel based on what is in the set
else [if the magnitude of the number> 2: STOP;
	make the color : actual color*( 1-steps/max)
		scale it 

0, z0, z1...
0, C, C^2+C,...
