eye (x, y, z)

set z = 0
scale x, y

hit one sphere--> sphere's color
hit none--> background color

Equation for the line for the ray
rx = px - ex (pixel, eye)
rx /= normalize
etc
x = ex + T*rx (1)
looking up, T is negative (floor behind)

substitute eq(1) into (x - cx)^2 + (y - cy)^2 + (z - cz)^2 = R^2
--> aT^2 + bT + c
a = 1.0
b = 
c = __ - R^2
Hint:
dx = ex - cx

Discriminant:
if more than one:pick the closer color (find the smallest T)
